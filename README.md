# Dotfiles

This is a collection of some of my most important dotfiles for desktop configuration. I am using the i3 window manager, polybar, alacritty terminal and picom compositor. As of yet, these files have only been mildy customized but are still altered enough to provide a comfortable and attractively riced desktop.
